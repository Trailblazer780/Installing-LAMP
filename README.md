## Downloading Apache

The first step to take is to visit this website: https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi and get the latest stable version of Apache web server. You then must click on the link that says Apache httpd for Microsoft Windows is available from a few third-party vendors. A screen shot is provided below as to where to click for this download.

After clicking that link you can scroll down to the heading that says Downloading Apache for Windows and select a third-party vendor to download it from.

For this example, we will be using the Apache Lounge. This link will take you to a new website that you can download apache from. You will be given 2 options for windows download. One of them being for a 64-Bit operating system and the other for a 32-Bit operating system. Select whichever one applies to you.
